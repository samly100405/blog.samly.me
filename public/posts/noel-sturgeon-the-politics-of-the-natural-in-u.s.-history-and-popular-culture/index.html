  "articleBody": "Intro “Human nature” has been historically used to justify social inequality. Human nature for women to submit to men Human nature that black people and colored people are less sophisticated than white people Most assume that the line between nature and culture (manmade) is clear, however Sturgeon claims that the two can blend into each other. GMO, stem cell research, in-vitro fertilization, cloning ==Nature can be seen as non-human, and culture can be seen as human== Our efforts in preserving “wild nature” can itself be seen as artificial, since we are putting effort into saving wildlife, that would have otherwise died, thus altering the path of “nature” By putting money into the equation for wildlife, wildlife preserves become commoditized. ==In nature, extinction is natural, so is doing everything we can to preserve every possible really “preserving nature”?== Using Arguments from Nature as a Tool of Power Use of arguments from nature to perpetuate social norms “calling something “natural” places it in an arena of truth” Sturgeon claims it is critical that we understand the ideological use of “the natural” in politics, because those in power will use “the natural” as a way to win over the public. Early American revolutionaries pulled ideas from Enlightenment ideals like naturalism to justify their revolt. European monarchies were seen as unnatural, but a democracy demonstrates “natural law” because the people create the laws that they follow. They believed that white men were created equal, so no white man should rule over another. This sentiment of egalitarianism did not apply to those of color and women, because they themselves still wanted power over a group of people. To justify this, they used “human nature” and how different genders and races are created differently. Because women give birth, the “naturalism” argument has been used to justify why they are responsible for domestic tasks, despite the fact that nature has no bearing on having the woman sew clothes. ==“The natural” can be used both to justify equality, and inequality.== arguments from the natural often settle the question for those who benefit from the social arrangement in question, [and] can convince those who suffer from inequality and exploitation to accept their situation.\nThe effects of using arguments from nature Arguments from nature can be used for both conservative and progressive goals. One shouldn’t always assume that arguments from nature are always to perpetuate social inequality, but we should always be critical of said arguments, because those arguments can be used for those purposes. However, constantly being critical of arguments from nature can cause people to believe that nature itself is a social construct used by those in power to manipulate the public. The idea that nature is a social construct can then lead people to believe that since we are products of nature, everything we do is natural, thus we can do anything we want with the “non-human world”. (one of the arguments for logging, oil mining, etc.) Arguments from nature often imply a clear line between the human and natural world (ie, we should not log this forest because it is natural.) However, humans and nature exist co-dependently, and destroying nature would destroy us. ==Although there is not a clear line between the human and natural world, there needs to be a clear line between what humans can do within the natural world, in order to protect nature, and in turn protect us from ourselves.== Instead of thinking of nature as a separate entity that needs to be protected, we need to think of nature as a part of us, that needs to be protected. Patterns of Nature in U.S. Popular Culture The idea of nature has a diverse set of interpretations, some contradicting others. Using any given interpretation of nature can create arguments for any given social viewpoint. There are three formal “senses”(not interpretations) of nature: the essential quality and character of something the inherent force which directs either the world or human beings or both the material world itself, taken as including or not including human beings Most believe that there is a separation between the natural and artificial, however most can’t agree on the boundary between the two. Most are uncomfortable with the idea that humans and nature co-exist as one, because it blurs the line between the natural and manmade. The natural tends to have a notion of purity and superiority over the manmade. Advertising Natures Advertisements serve as a reflection of what the public views as desirable. Ads are meant to be appealing to as many people as possible, so they show the dominant interpretations of societal notions. (what is good, what is bad, what is desirable to most people.) Ads will draw upon “commonsense knowledge” of the public to create something desirable. By analyzing what “commonsense knowledge” was used in ads involving nature, we can determine the dominant interpretation of nature. The most common patterns in advertising also show the prejudice riddled in American society Nature is female, white women are pure, women of color are animalistic/primitive, heterosexuality is natural, masculinity is associated with conquering nature, indigenous peoples are primitive. 1994 Discovery Channel “Explore Your World” ad ![[Pasted image 20230912154230.png | 400]]\nWhen asked to point to the white man, most point to the pilot. Pattern of technology/civilization being associated with whiteness, and primitive with darkness Everyone else, despite coming from vastly different cultures, are placed in the same category as “primitive” or “natural” showing a pattern of generalizing nature to everything outside of the civilized world. The caption implies that the the faces are to be discovered. The “discovery” of these people will inevitably lead to their colonization. This implies another pattern, that of the inevitable “progress” from nature to civilization. Masculine vs. Feminine ideals in Ads ![[Pasted image 20230912161736.png]]\nNature as female (Mother nature) This creates implies female inferiority as it implies the feminine is more “primitive” While women are shown to be nature, men are shown to explore and control nature. Perpetuates male dominance [[Jean Kilbourne - Two Ways Women Can Get Hurt Notes]] Purity and animality in nature and the feminine ![[Pasted image 20230912163607.png]]\nWhen white women are associated with nature, they are associated with purity. In the first ad, a blonde woman is shown in a waterfall to advertise shampoo. This implies the shampoo is “pure.” The woman on the left in the third ad is white and vegetarian, showing her purity. When women of color are associated with nature, they are associated with the primitive or animality. The second ad shows a woman of color posing in a more aggressive way. The asian woman in the third ad is dressed in dark clothes, with the caption “man-eater” implying that she is not “pure” This ad also implies that there are two types of women: the pure, and the impure. Nature as something to conquer/claim ![[Pasted image 20230912164214.png|300]]\nimplies “nature should be claimed, and you can do so with our car.” Environmentalist Images of Nature Environmentalist images of nature often depict a photo of earth taken from space. Yaakov Garb claims this image feminizes Earth, because it turns Earth into “an object that can be gazed upon at will, owned, and contained.” Environmentalist images can appeal to maternity, “It’s Time for Women to Mother Earth” This also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women having to “clean up” after others. ==Environmentalists are trapped into stereotyping because they have to appeal to the masses. By using existing stereotypes, people are more likely to listen.== ",

<li>Nature as female (Mother nature)</li>
<li>This creates implies female inferiority as it implies the feminine is more &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;</li>
<li>While women are shown to <em>be</em> nature, men are shown to <em>explore and control</em> nature.

<li>When white women are associated with nature, they are associated with purity.
<ul>
<li>In the first ad, a blonde woman is shown in a waterfall to advertise shampoo. This implies the shampoo is &ldquo;pure.&rdquo; The woman on the left in the third ad is white and vegetarian, showing her purity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When women of color are associated with nature, they are associated with the primitive or animality.
<ul>
<li>The second ad shows a woman of color posing in a more aggressive way. The asian woman in the third ad is dressed in dark clothes, with the caption &ldquo;man-eater&rdquo; implying that she is not &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>This ad also implies that there are two types of women: the pure, and the impure.</li>

<ul>
<li>Environmentalist images of nature often depict a photo of earth taken from space.
<ul>
<li>Yaakov Garb claims this image feminizes Earth, because it turns Earth into &ldquo;an object that can be gazed upon at will, owned, and contained.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Environmentalist images can appeal to maternity, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Time for Women to Mother Earth&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>This also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women having to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; after others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>==Environmentalists are trapped into stereotyping because they have to appeal to the masses. By using existing stereotypes, people are more likely to listen.==</li>

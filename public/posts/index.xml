      <description>Intro &amp;ldquo;Human nature&amp;rdquo; has been historically used to justify social inequality. Human nature for women to submit to men Human nature that black people and colored people are less sophisticated than white people Most assume that the line between nature and culture (manmade) is clear, however Sturgeon claims that the two can blend into each other. GMO, stem cell research, in-vitro fertilization, cloning ==Nature can be seen as non-human, and culture can be seen as human== Our efforts in preserving &amp;ldquo;wild nature&amp;rdquo; can itself be seen as artificial, since we are putting effort into saving wildlife, that would have otherwise died, thus altering the path of &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; By putting money into the equation for wildlife, wildlife preserves become commoditized.</description>
